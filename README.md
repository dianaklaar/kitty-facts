## Kitty Facts
Kitty Facts emerged from a project created at [Malmö University](https://mau.se/) as part of the course [Cross-platform Applications with Web Technologies](https://edu.mah.se/en/Course/DA355A), and was created by [Birger Norrman](https://github.com/BirgerNorrman), [Diana Klaar](https://github.com/dianaklaar), and [Zandra Nilsson](https://github.com/zandrainilsson). 

[Alex Wohlbruck](https://github.com/alexwohlbruck)’s API [cat-facts](https://alexwohlbruck.github.io/cat-facts/) and [TheCatAPI](https://docs.thecatapi.com/) by [Aden Forshaw](https://github.com/AdenForshaw), are being used in the project to fetch both random facts about cats and images of cats which can be saved in a list by the user’s liking.
